# Fabric Waystones (Custom Names)

Fork of Fabric Waystones mod that allows for waystone names to
be chosen randomly from a list specified in the config file. 
I made this for my personal use because
I think it's funny to make all of the waystones named after U.S. cities. 
This is not going to be maintained or updated and only works with 1.18, use
at your own risk!
